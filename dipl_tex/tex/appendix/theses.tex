\begin{enumerate}
	\item The abs-normal form can be an implementationary basis to handle piecewise linear functions.
	\item The Generalized Midpoint Rule is an efficient tool to solve ODEs with piecewise linear right hand side.
	\item The Generalized Midpoint Rule has second order convergence for composite smooth functions.
	\item The Generalized Midpoint Rule yields feasible results for smaller step sizes than classical methods.
	\item A significant improvement of convergence can be achieved with the Generalized Midpoint Rule when compared to classical methods.
